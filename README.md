Summary

In this project, I worked on end-to-end data analysis and visualization using AWS services. I used CLI commands to transfer raw data to S3, which served as the central storage for structured and semi-structured datasets. IAM roles were configured to provide the necessary access permissions, and Lambda functions automated the conversion of JSON files to Parquet format. Using AWS Glue Studio, I created an ETL job to merge two tables and build a database for analytics and reporting. Finally, Amazon QuickSight was used to visualize the processed data, enabling interactive dashboards and actionable insights.
